# midi-instruments

A collection of **web-based MIDI instruments.** I wanted to create a MIDI instrument that allows me to jam with other musicians. Play MIDI with your PC keyboard, or with a touch screen.

## MIDI setup

MIDI communicates via MIDI ports. This section describe on setting them up.


### Physical MIDI ports

If you connect a physical MIDI port to your computer, no further setup is necessary.


### Sending MIDI messages to another app on the same computer

You need to create a __virtual MIDI cable__ (a.k.a. <acronym title="inter-application communication">IAC</acronym> driver or loopback MIDI interface).

- On __macOS:__ Open __Audio MIDI Setup__ and go to __MIDI Studio.__ Inside the __IAC Driver,__ create a new __Bus.__

- On __Windows:__ You can use something like LoopBe1 I guess.


### iOS &rarr; Mac

You can use the __Web MIDI Browser__ app, a iOS web browser that supports Web MIDI API.
Then you can set up a Bluetooth LE connection from your iDevice to Mac.


## Offline iOS App

For offline playing, you can find an Xcode project in the [ios](ios) folder and compile it yourself.
